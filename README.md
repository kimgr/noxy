Dead simple Windows UI for toggling use of automatic configuration script.

Sometimes proxies are great, sometimes they're not.

The *Use automatic configuration script* setting under *Internet Options* > *Connections* > *LAN settings*
has caused me enough trouble that I wanted to be able to be able to toggle it with a simple manoeuvre.

**noxy** monitors this setting and lets you change it with a single button-press.
